        Oyster Wars is a 2D pixel art game made with the Monogame framework and C#.
        It is centered around a core hookshot mechanic that acts as the principal action of the game. 
        The player must use the hookshot creatively for platforming and item manipulation. 
        The ECS, level importer, gameplay logic, artwork, level design and music were all created by me.
        The game features rich system driven puzzle platforming as well as intuitive and deep movement controls.
        I feel close to the project because I feel it showcases my ability to create 3Cs, game systems, engaging levels, story and atmosphere.
