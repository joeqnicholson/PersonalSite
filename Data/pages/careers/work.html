    I was tasked with managing a team of programmers and writing tests plans for them to execute. 
    The team and I would create tests through a hybrid of in engine functions using C# and a Python library that emulates player input.
    These tests were then run daily on a large variety of Android and iOS devices, as well as on Nintendo Switch. 
    All tracking of test plans were done through JIRA.

	At Global Step, I was contracted to work on an action-adventure game at Eidos Montreal; my role was to ensure the quality of the 3Cs. 
    I Verified morning and nightly builds of the movement and camera systems and wrote daily reports on the state of current fixes and bugs.
    In Unreal Engine 4, I would modify blueprints to test different scenarios of gameplay to help with bug finding. 
    After finding the cause of issues I uploaded footage of bugs along with descriptions and recreation steps to JIRA.
