        I studied at a Web Development Bootcamp where I learned Javascript, Ruby, React, Redux and SQL.
        I pair programmed 6-8 hours per day and built 3 complete web applications. 
        One of the applications I created called 'plantr' sends email reminders to water the users plants, it is still used as a teaching resource at the school.
